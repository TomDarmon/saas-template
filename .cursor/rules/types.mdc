- Types: export domain types from `src/types`; keep names descriptive and stable.
- Schemas: keep JSON Schemas versioned by domain (`v1/`); mirror TS types where consumed by UI.
- Nullability: prefer explicit `null` over `undefined` for data shapes crossing the wire, try to limit the use of `null` as much as possible.
